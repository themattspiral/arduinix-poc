At this point in the development process, this project is still very much in its early stages, and is being done as a hobby/passion project by @themattspiral in his spare time. This, combined with the fact that the code is still very much in flux while Matt experiements with different approaches and techniques, means that the project is not accepting pull requests at this time.
